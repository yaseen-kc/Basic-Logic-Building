# Basic Logic Building

Welcome to the "Basic Logic Building" repository, where you can learn and practice fundamental programming concepts. This repository covers two important topics: Array and Pattern Printing in C, as well as Basic Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Syntax.

## Array and Pattern Printing in C

In this section, you will find examples, explanations, and exercises related to arrays and pattern printing in the C programming language. These fundamental concepts are essential for building strong programming logic.

### Contents
1. **Arrays in C**: Learn about arrays, how to declare and use them, and various operations on arrays.
2. **Pattern Printing**: Explore different patterns that you can print using loops and nested loops in C.

## Basic Java OOPs Syntax

In the second section of this repository, we will cover the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. OOP is a key concept in modern software development, and this section provides a solid foundation for understanding Java's OOP syntax.

### Contents
1. **Classes and Objects**: Understand how to create classes and objects in Java, defining attributes and methods.
2. **Inheritance**: Learn about inheritance, one of the four pillars of OOP, and how it works in Java.
3. **Polymorphism**: Explore polymorphism and how it is implemented in Java through method overriding.
4. **Encapsulation**: Discover the concept of encapsulation and how it helps in data hiding and data protection.
